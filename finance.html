        <h2 class="blog-post-title"> Budgeting </h2>
        <p> <h5 style="margin-top: 4px;"> Money- the vice or the virtue? </h5> <br>
          Before we begin discussing what budgeting is, it is important to understand what influences our financial decisions. On an average, a single person can have several value systems which work together to determine, what we call, his <strong> money personality</strong>.
        </p>
          <p> We hear a lot about the different personalities of people- a person can be calm or cruel, intelligent or ignorant; but what exactly is a money personality? Quite simply, it is the disposition a person assumes when dealing with money which may or may not have a correlation with his personality when dealing with people. But most often, these personalities are the result of a person's value systems and since value systems evolve with time and experience, it follows that the money personality of a person can also change.
          </p>
          Having said that, money is still a very sceptical thing for most people to deal with. For an average twenty year old who has just begun to earn money and has no prior basic financial knowledge, the prospect of money can be quite overwhelming. The first step to get around this issue is to maintain a <strong> budget.</strong> Budgets are subjective and different people can have entirely different budgets. Though budget-making might seem to be boring, futile and herculean, it is the most effective way towards financial management because in order to manage your finances, it is first important to know your finances inside out; to know where your money is, where it is going and then planning where it should go. Once you decide a financial goal for yourself, you need to create a personal balance sheet by following these steps: 
          <ol>  <img src="mo.jpg"  width="350" height="200" style="float:right;"><br>
          <li> Access your current financial standing.</li>
          <li> Itemize list of income and other cash inflows.</li>
          <li> Itemize list of expenses and other cash outflows.</li>
          <li> Identify your goals and determine how much you need to save to reach those goals. </li>
          <li> Add everything up to compare income with expenses. </li>
          <li> Determine whether you're in surplus or deficit and make adjustments. </li>
        </ol> <br>
         <h6 style="font-size: 120%;">Let us understand this using an example.</h6>
        <p> Nandini is from Mumbai and studies at MNNIT, Allahabad in the final year. She is planning to save money to buy a new phone in the next 10 months, just before graduation. The phone she likes costs around INR 20,000 and she decides to itemize her income and expense (on a monthly basis) as follows:
          <ol> 
          <li> Her income- INR 2500 from scholarship and INR 2000 from her parents.</li>
          <li> Her expenses- INR 1000 over online courses, books and stationary, INR 1000 over food, transport and recreation.</li>
          <li> She has been saving INR 2000 for her phone and INR 500 as emergency funds.  </li>
          <li> Thus, her income= INR 4500 and her expenses + savings= INR 4500</li>
          <li> Thus, her budget sheet is perfectly balanced and she, with this model, can achieve her short term goal of buying a new phone.</li>
</ol>
<h6 style="font-size: 120%;">Let us talk about the budget- making terms in detail.</h6>
<ol type="I"> <br>
  <img src="income.jpg"  width="350" height="200" style="float:right;">
<li> <h6> Itemizing Income </h6> </li>
<p> In general terms, itemizing income means creating a complete listing of all income. These can be of two major categories:</p>
  <ol>
    <li> Income from current employment </li>
    <li> Other income </li>
    <ul>
      <li> Loans </li>
      <li> Scholarships </li>
      <li> Income from family, friends </li>
      <li> Retirement or pension </li>
      <li> Investment or interest income </li>
    </ul>
  </ol>
  <br>
  <img src="expense.jpg"  width="350" height="200" style="float:right;"> 
  <li> <h6> Itemizing Expense </h6></li>
  <p> Expense itemzing is the listing of the expenses. These expenses can be divided in three categories: </p>
  <ol>
    <li> Fixed Expenses </li>
    <ul>
      <li> Rent, cell phone, cable, Internet </li>
      <li> Car, health insurances </li>
      <li> Loan payments </li>
    </ul>
    <li> Variable Expenses </li>
    <ul>
      <li> Food, gas, utilities </li>
      <li> Credit Card payments </li>
    </ul>
    <li> Non-essential Expenses </li>
    <ul>
      <li> Entertainmeant, luxury items </li>
    </ul>
  </ol>
  <br>
  <img src="save.jpg"  width="350" height="200" style="float:right;">
  <li> <h6> Savings </h6></li>
  <p> Savings, it is important to note, are included as part of the total budget model. The surplus or deficit amount in a person's balance sheet is the money left after taking into account the expenses and savings. In the above example, Nandini saves INR 500 every month without fail and includes it as a mandatory aspect in her budget model. Savings are of three broad categories: </p>
  <ol>
    <li> Emergency Savings- in the event of - </li>
    <ul>
      <li> Job loss </li>
      <li> Automobile repairs </li>
      <li> Unprecedented medical expenses </li>
    </ul>
    <li> Short-term savings </li>
    <ul>
      <li> Travel, new phone, new TV </li>
    </ul>
    <li> Longer-term savings </li>
    <ul>
      <li> College/ Education </li>
      <li> New car or home </li>
      <li> Retirement </li>
    </ul>
  </ol>

        <p> <h5 style="margin-top: 4px;"> Compounding Interest- the time value of money </h5> </p> <br>
        <p> Investing money is the process of allocating your money with the hope that they give you a good return in the future. Investment is one way of reaping the benefits of compounding interest. Investments can be made in several ways and require a good understanding of the market risks that are associated with it. </p>

</svg> <strong> Note- </strong> Another very important thing to be considered when making an investment is to first ensure that your personal finance is secured, that you are capable of taking a risk and if you were to suffer a loss, you won't hit rock bottom and become broke the next day. Though seems implicit, most people often rush towards making an investment majorly because they have seen or know someone who became succesful though it. However, making an investment without ensuring you have your other sources secured can be a very dangerous step. Thus, before making an investment, one must ensure that:
          <ol> <img src="investment.jpg" width="350" height="200" style="float:right;">
            <li> They have a budget and have a good credit history </li>
            <li> They are able to pay their bills on time </li>
            <li> They have healthy finances </li>
            <li> They have an insurance which protects them against risk </li>
            <li> They have <strong> emergency savings </strong> </li>
          </ol>
        <p> Generally, investments can be made in the following ways:</p>
        <ol>
          <li> Deposits in banks </li>
          <li> Stocks </li>
          <li> Bonds </li>
        </ol>
        <dl>
          <dt>Deposits</dt>
          <dd>When a person wishes to allocate some portion of his money towards making a deposit at a bank, they receive the benfits of compunding interest, which essentially means their money multiplies into larger and larger amounts due to the interest rates offered by the bank and the effect of time on an investment.</dd>
          <dt>Stocks</dt>
          <dd> They're the most popular form of making an investment and have often proved to be the most effective in long term investments. When you buy a stock, you essentially own a piece of the company. Gaining money on stocks can happen in two ways:</dd>
          <ol>
            <li> Capital Gains- the company performs well and the stock goes up so that you sell it at a profit </li>
            <li> Dividends- The company pays stockholders a dividend which is a portion of the profit the company gains </li>
          </ol>
          <dd> Losses in a stock can happen when the company performs bad and the prices go down which compels you to sell it at a loss </dd>
          <dt> Bonds </dt>
          <dd> They're also effective for investing but can be risky due to the changing market dynamics. When you own a bond of a company, it means you loan some money to the company. Earning in a bond can happen by-  </dd>
          <ol>
            <li> The interest money paid by the company to you. </li>
            <li> When the interest rates go down, the value of the bond goes up and you can sell your bond at a profit.</li>
          </ol>
          <dd> You lose money on a bond when the inflation in the market rises, consequently decreasing the value of your bond which compels you to sell it at a loss. </dd>
        </dl>

  <h2 class="blog-post-title"> Saving </h2>
  <p> <h5 style="margin-top: 4px;"> Save money for future plans or spend to achieve goals now? </h5> </p> <br>
<p> Saving is one concept of financial management that everyone seems to understand the significance of, but still turns out to be one of the most difficult things to do. The prospect of having extra cash in hand is not only delightful but also very enticing, which can often lead to people spending that money on stray items rather than saving it up. But, saving is crucial. Not only because it is one way of assuring that you don't run over your budget by indulging in useless expenses, but also because the saved up money acts as a buffer and can provide invaluable support in case of unforseen circumstances and emergencies. 
</p>
  <p> Now saving money doesn't mean you have to turn into a money hoarder or a miser and develop a fanatic obsession with saving every dime so that you don't even spend money on basic requirements.<br> No. <br> Money, after all, is a medium through which you can plan your future and dreams and you must make sure that you don't turn into a extremist when it comes to saving money. What saving actually requires you to do is to allocate a portion of your wealth towards a dedicated cause. That cause could be subjective and absolutely vary from person to person. Most people believe in dedicating some portion towards creating an emergency fund which can be used in the drastic events of a job loss or sudden medical expenses. But apart from that, savings can be done for a particular goal too. 
  </p>
    <p> For instance, you can save money for some short term goals like buying a new phone, a new guitar or a new computer and include them in your budget. Similarly, you can also start saving for long term goals like buying a home, buying a new car or money for a big investment.
     </p>
      <p> Inculcating the habit of saving from a young age can be very beneficial to realise one's goal. While saving for future plans and post-retirement life is a good idea, it is also advised to divide the long-term goals of life into shorter components and save while living your dreams now and gaining experiences. After all, life is meant to be lived in the best possible way and while being money-prudent is important, so is acheiving your small, short term goals. Abandoning a short all-friend trip in the hope of saving money for your retirement when you are barely thirty is too far-fetched a financial plan and hence, one must endeavour to strike a congrous balance between saving for the future and spending judiciously on your dreams now. 
      </p>
      <p> And yes, as mentioned before too, saving isn't only meant for long, difficult or emergency needs. Saving can be fun too! When you have a good amount of money saved up, which, is more than what you might require for your goal, do not stop saving! Remember, the money you save is meant to be a buffer and so, if you have saved up more than you need, it means you've been extremely good at managing your finances and have been regular. So, go and reward yourself with a good vacation to the Swiss Alps!</p>
