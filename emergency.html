<p class="P1"> EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT </p>
<div class="container">
  <p> Life, with all its virtues and wonder, is still very unpredictable. And though one might spend a considerable amount of time managing their finances or getting someone else to manage them, it is still possible for some unpredictable, unfortunate misery to strike which can render all the planning useless if one does not prepare for it beforehand. Now, this might seem counterintuitive- How can you prepare for an emergency when you do not know if or when that emergency will strike? <br>
    Well, one definitely can't predict when adversity strikes, but one must always be well prepared for it. The first way to get around this preparation is allocating some of your financial management towards emergency planning. This invloves:
    <ol>
      <li class="li1"> Emergency fund creation </li>
      <li class="li1"> Insurance </li>
      <li class="li1"> Flexible deposits </li>
    </ol>
<div class="row featurette  my-5 align-items-center d-flex">
      <div class="col-md-7">
        <h2 class="featurette-heading"> Emergency funds </h2>
        <p class="lead"> When an emergency strikes, it can lead to drastic consequences. Whether a medical emergency or a sudden motor or electronic repair emergency, each of them requires money to deal with. In these circumstances which are an amalgamation of snap decisions, money worries should literally be as far as possible. Hence, an emergency fund is needed specifically to cater to immediate adversities such as medical expenses, repairs or the unfortunate event of a job loss. <br>
         To create an emergency fund is no rocket science. All you need to do is dedicate some portion of your money (as enlisted in your budget) towards the fund. This money needs to be put towards the fund on a regular and fixed basis, without fail. Now you might wonder that if all your money goes towards savings and emergency funds, then what will you even be left with? Well, there is no real need to panic or worry because these savings and funds only require you to put away some portion of your total money. That portion is something you get to choose based on your financial situation and your risk factors. <br>
        And even though you might feel that all this saved up money is being saved up for nothing and that instead, you could actually use it to buy some expensive gadget in the stores or spend on a nice vacation, do your best to resist this temptation. Quite frankly, you are doing yourself a great deed by saving up money for an emergency fund because if, and we at FinaBoost pray that you don't, you find yourself in an emergency, you would thank yourself for resisting the temptation and saving up.

        <h2 class="featurette-heading"> Insurance </h2>
        <p class="lead"> The first question that might pop in the head of thirty year old, hearing about insurance might be- Why do I need an insurance? I am quite healthy; insurance is for the oldies!<br>
          Well, then, you are wrong.  <strong> Insurance is an arrangement between an individual and a company that outlines the circumstances under which the insurer will compensate the insured for a damage or a loss. And, that arrangement doesn't only apply to the old. </strong> <br>
          An insurance is a piece of guarantee that protects you from any damage that might have the potential to hurt you. As mentioned above, life is very unpredictable and one doesn't get warned before injury strikes. Hence, one way to protect yourself is to get an insurance. Usually, an insurance contract requires the insured to pay the company providing insurance some money called the premium. The premium an individual pays depends on a lot of factors. <br>
          Most often, insurances can be of the following types:
          <ol>
            <li> <dd> Fire Insurance: </dd> <dt> It protects your property from any sort of damage due to fire hazards. </dt> <br></li>
            <li> <dd> Health Insurance: </dd> <dt> It protects you by covering the medical expenses for illnesses, injuries or medical conditions. </dt> <br> </li>
            <li> <dd> Life Insurance: </dd><dt> It protects your loved ones in the unfortunate event of death by providing a coverage and a death benefit to the policy's beneficiaries. </dt> <br></li>
          </ol>

        <h2 class="featurette-heading">Flexible Deposits </h2>
        <p class="lead"> As spoken of above, in an emergency, the concern of accessing money should be the last thing in your mind and as an extension of the creation of emergency funds, we would like to share an advice with you.<br> When you set aside some money for an emergency fund, then you can do that in several ways- you can put aside cash or create an emergency account. Some people even commit their money to some market account so that while they put away the money in the name of an emergency fund, they can also earn a good interest rate on the sitting money. To be frank, that money is not an emergency fund, that is investment. When you set aside an emergency fund, then it is not advised to put it under an investment hood because when you invest your money, then you agree to a list of terms of the company or institute you invest in. You agree to a time frame and while they offer you a good interest rate, they do not allow you to access your money before the time frame ends.<br> In an emergency situation where you need instant help, you cannot afford to waste time dealing with the terms of the company's investment policy; you need an instant access to money. Hence, it is adviced not to put your emergency money as an investment which restricts your access to the money or makes it difficult for you to retrieve it. <br> <svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="16" height="16" fill="currentColor" class="bi bi-bar-chart-line-fill" viewBox="0 0 16 16">

</svg><em> Advice-</em> Always have some cash in hand. No matter how many accounts, cards or investments you have, cash is always the king! Mainly, because it is the most easily accessible. Hence, always have a decent amount stashed up as cash! </p>
