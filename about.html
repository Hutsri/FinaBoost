        <p class="lead"> Our website is a one-stop location that aims to explain the significance of financial management. Conceived primarily with the goal to inculcate financial management skills among young adults, it extends to cater to anyone curious to learn the nuances of money-dealing. Though a primitive website, the developers have endeavoured to explain the concepts of financial planning and emergency planning as extensively as possible. </p>

        <p class="lead"> The skill of dealing with money. Though a very elaborate and extensive concept in itself, FinaBoost aims to focus predominantly on Budgeting, Investing and Savings along with a brief introduction to emergency planning. <br>
          Money is one very integral part of human life. Each one of us dreams of a certain lifestyle, a certain standard of life which are absolutely subjective. However, to convert those dreams into reality, as much as you need skill, determination and conviction, you also need money. Money does not only serve as an investment, but also as an index of development and while earning money is tough, spending it is extremely easy if done without any financial aptitude. This makes financial literacy an extremly crucial skill to develop.

        <h2 class="featurette-heading"> Why should you begin financial planning from adolosence? </h2>
        <p class="lead"> Financial planning is a skill; and just like any other skill, the earlier one begins, the better one ends up. While an average person starts earning money in their mid 20s, one should always endeavour to learn to use and spend their money as early as possible. Hence, the years leading up to the workforce age, primarily the young adult years, are considered to be the most suitable to instill the sense of money so that it could be put to judicious use in fulfilling dreams. And, as young collegians who probably are living or going to live independently, with limited money and flexible expenditures, forming an economical sense of money, ideally, begins around that time and could be sharpened towards pragmatic use of money.</p>
